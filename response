o	Predictability: It’s easier to predict timelines, costs, and outcomes since the entire project is planned upfront.
o	Documented process: Each phase has clear deliverables, which can be useful for compliance-heavy projects.
•	Disadvantages:
o	Inflexible: Changes are difficult to accommodate once the project is underway.
o	Late-stage testing: Testing occurs near the end of the project, which can lead to major issues being discovered too late.
4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is better suited for:
•	Software products with evolving requirements: Projects where the requirements are likely to change frequently or are not well-defined at the outset.
o	Example: A mobile app development project where user feedback is used to refine features regularly.
•	Innovative or experimental projects: When new technologies or features are being tested, Agile’s iterative process can help adapt to changes and uncertainties.
o	Example: Developing a new SaaS platform that needs rapid prototyping and continuous iteration.
Waterfall is better suited for:
•	Projects with well-defined requirements: Where the scope, timeline, and deliverables are clearly understood and unlikely to change.
o	Example: Building a legacy enterprise system with fixed specifications.
•	Regulated industries: Where compliance with specific standards is required, such as government contracts or healthcare applications.
o	Example: Developing a medical device software where regulatory approval and certification require a strict process and documentation.
5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Methods for ensuring quality assurance:
•	Automated testing: Running unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests automatically during development to catch issues early.
•	Code reviews: Peer reviews of code ensure adherence to standards, help identify bugs, and promote knowledge sharing.
•	Continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD): Automating the integration and deployment processes to catch bugs and ensure smooth delivery.
•	User testing: Regular usability and user acceptance testing (UAT) to verify that the software meets user needs.
•	Defining quality criteria: Establishing clear quality benchmarks and testing against them throughout the lifecycle.
Quality assurance is essential to maintain user satisfaction, reduce post-release bugs, and avoid costly rework. It also ensures that the software is reliable and meets the business requirements.
6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining the project scope ensures clarity about the project’s objectives, deliverables, and constraints. A well-defined scope helps avoid scope creep, where additional features or requirements are added without proper approval, leading to delays or budget overruns.
A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical breakdown of the project’s tasks and deliverables, organized into manageable sections. It is useful because:
•	Improves planning: Breaking down the project into smaller tasks makes it easier to estimate time, resources, and costs.
•	Tracks progress: A WBS helps monitor individual task completion and overall project status.
•	Clarifies responsibilities: Clearly defines roles and responsibilities for each part of the project.
7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
A detailed project schedule helps to:
•	Allocate resources effectively: Knowing when specific tasks need to be completed helps ensure the right resources are available at the right time.
•	Track progress: A schedule provides milestones and deadlines to ensure the project stays on track.
•	Identify bottlenecks: It helps to foresee any potential delays or dependencies that could affect other tasks.
A Gantt chart is a visual representation of the project schedule, showing the timeline of tasks, their durations, and dependencies. It is useful because:
•	Provides a clear overview of the entire project.
•	Helps visualize dependencies between tasks.
•	Allows easy tracking of milestones and deadlines.
